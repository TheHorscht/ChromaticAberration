# ChromaticAberration
A browser extension that gives you the ultimate gaming experience, in your browser!  
Are you tired of everything looking crispy clear and good?

Game developers worldwide have the answer: Just put chromatic aberration on everything!  
This extension brings the most popular post processing effect to your browser!

## Installation:
This extension is not in any addon-store because putting it in the google store costs $5, firefox is buggy and I don't care for other browsers (sorry).

If you want to try it out, you will have to install it manually as a debug extension.

Check out this repository or download it as a zip and then unpack it somewhere.

Then:
### For Chrome:
Check out this repository Go to the addon page (Options -> Additional Tools -> Addons), activate developer mode and click "import unpacked extension", chose the folder where the manifest.json is located.

### For Firefox:
Just type `about:debugging#addons` into the adress bar, then click "load temporary add-on", select the manifest.json
